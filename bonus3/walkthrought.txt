in this code we can simply exploit how atoi works and ths comparison at the end
if we pass an empty string to atoi it will get back the number 0 which is used
in the code as an index for thr buffer making it like an empty string, so when
is's compared to the argv[1] which is also an empty string it will return 0 and
launch a shell
